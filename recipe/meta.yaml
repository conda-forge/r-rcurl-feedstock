  license: BSD
  summary: A wrapper for libcurl. Provides functions to allow
    one to compose general HTTP requests and provides convenient functions to fetch
    URIs, get & post forms, etc. and process the results returned by the Web server.
    This provides a great deal of control over the HTTP/FTP/... connection and the form
    of the request while providing a higher-level interface than is available just using
    R socket connections.  Additionally, the underlying implementation is robust and
    extensive, supporting FTP/FTPS/TFTP (uploads and downloads), SSL/HTTPS, telnet,
    dict, ldap, and also supports cookies, redirects, authentication, etc.
